    <p class="about">Before Peter Gabriel had a hit with "In Your Eyes", and Phil Collins
       with the tantalizing "I Can Hear it Calling in the Air Tonight,"
       Genesis were one of the premiere rock groups coming from Great Britain's
       Burgeoning "prog-rock" scene. Although a lot less heavy than prog
       contemporaries like Yes and E.L.P., Genesis played a distinctive style
       that blended folk melodies with structures liberally borrowed
       from classical music. Theirs' was a music adventurous, playful and above
       all else breath-taking.
